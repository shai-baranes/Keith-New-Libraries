## 'rich'  library:
> for styling your console printouts (readability)
> also 'traceback' shall appear more appealing


## 'Path' library:
> alternative way to have a robust script that is not effected when you switch between directories (also not effected when switching netween build-systems e.g. REPL v. Terminus)



## 'tqdm' library:
> console progress bar with relevant naming to feel the progress



## 'pydantic' library:
> input validation to restrict: short/long strings, negative values, imprpoer assignment of arguments (in class or after) and hidding password as neccessary.



## 'ruff' library:
> helps in formatting the code, both to exhibit the issues and to fix if you allows it.
> I also understand that you can configure it to your needs (for highlighting the formatting deficiencies)
> example for pre-formatted code: code_pending_ruff_refactor - Copy.py

> To verify/check from cmd terminal:
> - *ruff check code_pending_ruff_refactor.py*

> To fix/format from cmd terminal:
> - *ruff format code_pending_ruff_refactor.py*

> To check and fix from cmd terminal:
> - *ruff check code_pending_ruff_refactor.py --fix*


## Note
>"keith" folder is actually the relevant virtual environment here. (not a must since the only new package here is 'rich' which is also installed on my main python lib)
